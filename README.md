This is a program created by me, i made it for Cs2d Server owners, allowing them to view thats going on in server even if they arent in it

Installation instructions:
1. extract Cs2dSpy into "sys/lua/" (so that you'll have sys/lua/Cs2dSpy/*files*)

2. edit sys/lua/server.lua

3. write in [code]dofile("sys/lua/Cs2dSpy/Cs2dSpy.lua")[/code]

4. start the game server, either using the normal cs2d client or by using a dedicated server

5. once the server has started, launch the jar (by double clicking, or right click open with > java)
